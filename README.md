# Netflix-Style Movie Recommendation System

![Movie Recommendation Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/netflix-recommendation-system/main/images/banner.jpg)

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Netflix-style movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. It features multiple recommendation algorithms and a user-friendly Streamlit web interface to explore and compare different recommendation approaches.

## Features

- **Multiple recommendation algorithms**:
  - Popularity-based recommendations
  - Content-based filtering using movie genres
  - Collaborative filtering with matrix factorization (SVD)
  - Item-based collaborative filtering with KNN
  - Hybrid recommendations combining multiple approaches

- **Interactive Streamlit interface** with:
  - Dataset exploration and visualization
  - Personalized recommendations for users
  - Movie similarity analysis
  - Genre distribution visualization
  - Comparison of recommendation algorithms

- **Robust implementation** with:
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Session state management
  - Performance optimizations for large datasets

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-recommendation-system.git
cd netflix-recommendation-system
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the MovieLens dataset:
   - Visit [grouplens.org/datasets/movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
   - Download the dataset of your choice (we recommend starting with "ml-latest-small")
   - Extract the ZIP file and place the CSV files in the `data` directory

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

3. In the app:
   - Enter the paths to your MovieLens CSV files
   - Click "Load Data" to process the dataset
   - Navigate through the tabs to explore different recommendation methods

## Algorithms Explained

### 1. Popularity-Based Recommendations

The simplest approach that recommends movies with the highest number of ratings and/or highest average ratings. Great for new users with no rating history.

### 2. Content-Based Filtering

Recommends movies similar to ones a user has liked based on movie features (genres in our implementation). Uses cosine similarity to find movies with similar genre profiles.

### 3. Collaborative Filtering

Identifies patterns in user preferences and predicts ratings based on how similar users have rated items. We implement matrix factorization using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

### 4. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Finds movies that are similar based on user rating patterns rather than content features. Uses k-Nearest Neighbors to identify movies that users tend to rate similarly.

### 5. Hybrid Recommendations

Combines collaborative filtering predictions with content-based similarity to provide more robust recommendations, overcoming the limitations of individual approaches.

## Future Improvements

- Add more features (actors, directors, plot keywords) for content-based filtering
- Implement deep learning recommendation models
- Add user registration and personalized profiles
- Incorporate movie posters and trailers
- Add evaluation metrics to compare algorithm performance
- Optimize for larger datasets with caching and more efficient computation
